# 🔑 STEP 1: Inject API Key into app.js

        # 1. Define the secret value as a safe shell variable
        GOOGLE_API_KEY_SAFE="${{ secrets.GOOGLE_API_KEY }}"
        
        # 2. Use 'sed' with the safe variable to replace the key placeholder
        # We use ':' as the delimiter to avoid conflicts with common API key characters like '/' or '+'.
        sed -i "s:___INJECT_GOOGLE_API_KEY___:${GOOGLE_API_KEY_SAFE}:g" app.js
        
        # 3. Diagnostic Check (IMPORTANT: confirms the placeholder is gone)
        if grep -q "___INJECT_GOOGLE_API_KEY___" app.js; then
          echo "::error::API Key injection FAILED! The placeholder still exists in app.js."
          exit 1
        else
          echo "✅ API Key successfully injected."
        fi

        # 4. (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED) Inject Client ID if it's also a secret
        # If your GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID is also stored as a secret, you must inject it here too.
        # If you are still using 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID' placeholder in app.js:
        # CLIENT_ID_SAFE="YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID" # Replace with ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID }} if it's a secret
        # sed -i "s:YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID:${CLIENT_ID_SAFE}:g" app.js
